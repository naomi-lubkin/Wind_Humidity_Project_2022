This rmd calculates wind load and analyzes trends over the years.
The drag coefficient was obtained from a study by Gilllies et al. (2002) that looked at three different plant species. For this analysis we used their drag coefficient of a Colorado Spruce.

# Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Calculate Wind Load 
Equation: Force = Area x Wind Pressure x Drag Coefficient
Wind Pressure = 0.00256 x (Wind Speed)^2
```{r}

```
